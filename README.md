# maze_generator
You need to have ffmpeg installed for animation.py to work.

To generate a maze, run generator.py, and input maze width/heigth (they are the same), then input resolution you'd like for your maze.png and wait.

For maze 1200x1200 I was waiting about 70s, so this shouldn't take too long.

To create animation from maze generation, run animation.py, input desired resolution and animation length and wait for the script to do the rest.
